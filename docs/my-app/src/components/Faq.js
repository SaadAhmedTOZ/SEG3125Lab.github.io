        <br />
        <p class="q">What is the Computer Engineering Club?</p>
        <p>The Computer Engineering Club is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering interest and learning in computer engineering. Our club provides a community for students to connect, learn, and engage with others who share their passion for computer engineering.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="q">Who can join the club?</p>
        <p>Our club is open to all students who are interested in computer engineering, regardless of their major. However, we primarily focus on topics related to computer engineering, so students who are not majoring in computer engineering may find some of our events less relevant to their interests.</p>

        <p class="q">What types of events and activities does the club promote?</p>
        <p>We promote a variety of events and activities throughout the year, including guest speaker presentations, workshops, hackathons, social events, and more. We also participate in various competitions and projects related to computer engineering. Check out our website or social media pages for more information on our upcoming events.</p>

        <br />
        <p class="q">Do I need to have prior knowledge or experience in computer engineering to join the club?</p>

        <br />
        <p class="q">How can I get involved in leadership positions within the club?</p>
        <p>We hold elections for officer positions at the end of each academic year. If you are interested in a leadership position, we encourage you to attend our meetings and events regularly and actively participate in club activities.
